AI CODING PROMPT — “Starry Night” Portfolio for Heet Shripal Kankariya

Prompt:

Create a complete, production-ready portfolio website using React + Vite for the frontend and Node.js + Express for the backend.

Color Palette (Starry Night–inspired):


Deep Blue: #0B3D91


Star Gold: #FFD700


Midnight Blue: #1C1C3C


Cream: #F5DEB3




Fonts: Artistic serif for headings, modern sans-serif for body (e.g., Playfair Display + Inter)


Animations: Rich, full artistic motion — swirling stars, soft parallax, glowing transitions, hover effects


Responsive: Fully responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop


Accessibility: Semantic HTML, alt text, focus outlines, and ARIA attributes

💡 How to use it:


Copy this entire prompt and paste it into ChatGPT, Replit Ghostwriter, Cursor IDE, or Copilot Chat.


It will generate all project files (frontend + backend).


Then you can upload it directly to Replit, VS Code, or GitHub.



Would you like me to run this prompt for you and output the actual project source code (React + Node.js) right here next?
That way, you can copy the code directly into your Replit or GitHub repository.
